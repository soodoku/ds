# Learning From Data

## Cosal Inference

* Five Habits of Successful People
	- Adopt these and you will be successful too!

* More frequent system crashes make people more likely to renew their license for the system.  

* I took the medicine and the fever went down

## Sins

* Selecting on the dependent variable

* Mistaking correlation for causation

* Treating temporally proximate as causal

* Abstract Sins:
	- Counteractuals
	- No manipulation

## Correlation

* How far away is a point from the mean?
	- $(x - \bar{x})$

* How far away from the mean are points on average?
	- Let's say there are $n$ points
	- We just care about the distance, not direction
	- $\frac{\Sigma_1^n (x - \bar{x})^2}{n}$

* Correlation:
	- $x$ tracks how hot it is outside and $y$ tracks ice-cream sales
	- When $x$ is large, is $y$ large too?
	- When $x$ is 1, is $y$ more likely to be 1 than when $x$ is 0?
	- As $x$ increases, does $y$ increase too?
		- Not precise still
		- On average, when $x$

	For each $x$, calculate how far it is from its mean
	- For each $y$, caculate how far it is from its mean
	- When How far away is y from its mean?
	- $(x - \bar{x}) (y - \bar{y})$

	- Linear relation
		- Anscombe's quarter
		- More amazing things
