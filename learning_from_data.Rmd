# Learning From Data

## Cosal Inference

* Five Habits of Successful People

* Children who play more violent video games are more violent

* I took the medicine and the fever went down

## Correlation

* How far away is a point from the mean?
	- $(x - \bar{x})$

* How far away from the mean are points on average?
	- Let's say there are $n$ points
	- We just care about the distance, not direction
	- $\frac{\Sigma_1^n (x - \bar{x})^2}{n}$

* Correlation:
	- We have data on temperatures ($x$) and ice-cream sales ($y$).
	- For each $x$, calculate how far it is from its mean
	- For each $y$, caculate how far it is from its mean
	- How far away is y from its mean?
	- $(x - \bar{x}) (y - \bar{y})$
